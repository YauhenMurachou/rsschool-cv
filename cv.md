**About Me:**
-----------
I want to build a career in web development. This is really interesting to me. I have a specific high education, a combination of humanitarian and technical education (lawyer and forensic expert). 6.5 years of experience as a forensic expert allowed me to develop such qualities as accuracy, attention to detail, efficiency, strict time management, etc. I've been studying front-end development since December 2020. I am interested in web development, because this job provides endless opportunities for professional growth,
in addition, there are a huge number of free, high-quality self-education resources and a large developer community. And to be honest, I just love to create something beautiful from scratch.

* HTML5, CSS3
* JavaScript
